Day 1: Java Data Types and Variables

"Hello everyone! I'm excited to start my 100-days Java challenge, and I'm looking forward to sharing my journey with you all.

Today, I'm diving into the basics of Java programming: data types and variables.
Java Data Types:
In Java, there are two main categories of data types: primitive types and reference types.
Primitive types include:
* Integers (int)
* Floating-point numbers (float, double)
* Characters (char)
* Boolean values (boolean)
* Byte (byte)
* Short (short)
* Long (long)

Reference types include:
* Strings (String)
* Arrays (e.g., int[], String[])
* Classes and objects (e.g., Person, Car)

Java Variables:
In Java, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. Variables have a specific data type, and they can be declared using the = operator.

Example:
int x = 10; // declare an integer variable x with value 10
String name = "John"; // declare a string variable name with value "John"

Key Takeaways:
Java has a range of primitive and reference data types to work with.
Variables are declared using the = operator and have a specific data type.
Understanding data types and variables is essential for writing effective Java code.

Next Steps:
Tomorrow, I'll be exploring more advanced topics in Java, including operators and control structures. Stay tuned!
